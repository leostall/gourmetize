## üìö Proposal

### Understanding the Business

The Brazilian gastronomic market is thriving, with diverse tastes and preferences. However, restaurant information is often scattered across various platforms, leading to a fragmented user experience. Users seek a centralized platform where they can easily access essential restaurant details such as menus, prices, amenities, and reviews.

### Problem Identification

- Information is dispersed across multiple sites, making it hard for users to find what they need.
- Most sites lack comprehensive filters, only allowing searches by cuisine type rather than specific dishes.
- Reviews often come from individuals who have never visited the restaurant, skewing perceptions of quality.
- Lack of clarity regarding the suitability of restaurants for celebrations.
- Absence of real-time waitlist functionality.

### Proposed Solution

Gourmetize addresses these challenges by providing a range of functionalities:

| ID | Feature Description |
|----|---------------------|
| 01 | **Secure Review**: Restaurant reviews are verified via a QR code available only at the venue. |
| 02 | **Restaurant Reservation**: Allows users to make reservations up to a day in advance. |
| 03 | **Coupons**: Offers a list of coupons for registered users. |
| 04 | **Online Queue**: Users can track their position in the waitlist in real time. |
| 05 | **Menu Display**: Shows restaurant menus with pricing. |
| 06 | **Parking Info**: Details about available parking options. |
| 07 | **Favorites**: Users can save restaurants to a favorites list for future visits. |
| 08 | **Login Functionality**: Enables access to enhanced features like feedback submission and coupon reception. |
| 09 | **Filters**: Allows users to filter restaurant content based on their preferences. |
| 10 | **Operating Hours**: Displays the hours of operation for restaurants. |
| 11 | **Proximity Search**: Suggests nearby restaurants based on user location and ratings. |
